                                <p>We’re a Community of over a million changemakers worldwide, working to build a more healthy and just planet. Together, we believe it's possible to create a society based on better not more, sharing not selfishness, community not division. We invite you to be inspired by and share our movies, participate in our study programs, and take part in our campaigns on the issues you care about.</p>

                                <p>In December 2007, Annie Leonard and her friends at Free Range Studios put a 20-minute movie about the way we make, use, and throw away Stuff on the internet, unleashing a torrent of pent-up demand for honest conversation about the impacts of our consumer-crazed culture on people and the planet. In the six years since The Story of Stuff was released, Annie’s ‘cartoon about trash’ has been viewed more than 40 million times worldwide.</p>
                                
                                <p class="dropquote">we make, use, and throw away Stuff</p>

                                <p>Annie responded to viewers’ thirst for more information and ways to get involved by founding The Story of Stuff Project in 2008. Since then, we’ve responded to our Community by releasing a best-selling book, co-creating a high school-level educational curricula called Buy, Use, Toss, developing a study program for faith communities, and launching a hope-filled podcast series called The Good Stuff that chronicles the efforts of everyday changemakers.</p>

                                <p>And yes, we’ve also created a series of new online movies! Season One -- The Story of Bottled Water, The Story of Cosmetics and The Story of Electronics -- used everyday consumer products to take a deeper look at where our Stuff comes from and where it goes when we throw it away. When our Community asked to go deeper, we created Season Two—The Story of Citizens United v. FEC, The Story of Broke and The Story of Change—which examines the underlying roots of our unsustainable production and consumption patterns: what makes the system tick, who pays, who benefits and how can we turn it around.</p>

                                <p>Now, having helped millions around the world understand and talk about the Story of Stuff, we’ve begun a collaborative pursuit of Solutions with the nearly 500,000 worldwide members of our Community. In 2014, we are launching our first, Community-generated and fueled campaigns to reduce plastic pollution, grow the sharing economy and end political corruption. And in late 2014, we’ll be offering Community members an innovative online Boot Camp aimed at helping them strengthen and flex their citizen muscles.</p>
