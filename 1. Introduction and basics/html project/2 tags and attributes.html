<p>but in actual pages <span title="keybord">tags</span> are used, like &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;. Each opening tag must have a closing tag (as shown), or else have the closing slash appended within the tag like &lt;br /&gt;</body></p>
<p><span title="keyword">Attributes</span> are defined with an = sign, and are added within the tag similarly to the end-slash in the single tag. they are always added to the first tag, never the closnig tag. The first word of this paragraph has hover text defined as an attribute. see if you can find another word on this page that would also have the same hint associated with it.</p>
