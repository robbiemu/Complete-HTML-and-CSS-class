				<h2>The image tag</h2>
				<p>Images can be inserted with the <span class="tag single">img</span> tag. Here is an example image:</p>
				<img src="hqdefault.jpg" class="center" />
				<p>Images are in-line-block elements by default. This means that they will try to merge with the flow of text if they are in a block containing one (such as in a <span class="tag">p</span> tag, but will render as block elements (whose spacing is not determined by the flow of text) in any other context. <img src="clippy.svg" style="height: 1em;" /> An example of that is the image inline at the start of this sentence!</p>
				<h2>Attributes</h2>
				<p>It takes a required <span class="attribute">src</span> attribute which is a link to an image file, either stored locally along with the page or available online. Any URL will do.</p>
				<p>The <span class="attribute">title</span> attribute is commonly used with the image tag.</p>
                <p>The <span class="attribute">alt</span> attribute will render even when the image does not.</p>
                <p>Image tags take <span class="attribute">width</span> and <span class="attribute">height</span> attributes. These are pixel values.</p>
